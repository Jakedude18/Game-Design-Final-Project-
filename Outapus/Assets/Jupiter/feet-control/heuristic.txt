####### TENTACLE CONTROL #######

- get position of "head" a short distance above ball object

- get position of "gaze" some distance in the direction of the input axis

- keep an array of 8 (for for now) target points

- raycast targeting beams distributed evenly, in the general direction of the input axis

	- update target points (in array) to the ray collisions closest to the "gaze" position

- use a step function, select some of the tentacle feet to control

- make sure the non-controlled feet stay on their spot

- try to re-position feet along a parabolic arc
