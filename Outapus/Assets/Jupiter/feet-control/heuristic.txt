####### TENTACLE CONTROL #######

- get position of "head" a short distance above ball object

- get position of "gaze" some distance in the direction of the input axis

- keep an array of 8 (for for now) target points

- raycast targeting beams distributed evenly, in the general direction of the input axis

	- !!! update target points (in array) to the ray collisions closest to the "gaze" position

- update feet targets toward hit points
	
	- keep one array of current feet targets, 2 more for their 'from' and 'to' hit positions, and 1 float array for 't' values

	- when current foot is NOT near its 'to' position (outside a small radius), interpolate using the t value, then increment t

	- when foot position comes close enough to 'to' target, switch values with 'from' and set 'to' to null

### Alternatively
- use a step function, select some of the tentacle feet to control

- make sure the non-controlled feet stay on their spot

- try to re-position feet along a parabolic arc
